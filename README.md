  logger:
    buffer_size: 142 # Queue size of entries to be logged.
    entry_max_size: 865536 # Max length of an entry message. Default 65536 bytes.

services:
  ggpull:
    pwd: /home/$USER/myapp
    command: git pull

  app:
    hooks:
      wait:
        - ggpull
    pwd: /home/$USER/myapp
    command: bundle exec rails s
    log_trim_pattern: '\[.*\] \w+  (?P<message>.*)'
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production

  worker:
    ignore_error: true # Do not stop other services on error
    hooks:
      wait: # wait for other processes before start
        - ggpull
      kill: # kill other processes on exit
        - app
    pwd: /home/$USER/myapp
    command: bundle exec sidekiq -c config/sidekiq.yml
```

### Trim logs

Outputed logs can be trimed to remove useless data like timestamp. This option is based on the Golang's [regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) package and you can test your regexp with the following website [Regex Tester - Golang](https://regex-golang.appspot.com/assets/html/index.html).

The captured group must be named `message` like the following example:

```
log_trim_pattern: '\[.*\] \w+  (?P<message>.*)'
```

The result is the following:

```
# Without trim:
[Feb 13 10:38:09]  INFO my_app: [2017-02-13 10:38:09] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

# With trim:
[Feb 13 10:38:09]  INFO my_app: WEBrick 1.3.1

# When the trim regexp does not match, the message is prefixed with `[!]`
[Feb 13 10:38:09]  INFO my_app: [!] => Booting WEBrick
```
